# NOOBS browser

What's this then ?

A fork of the RPi NOOBS system to use its fast booting web browser

- <b>Online Help</b>: [Networking Required] Open a browser that displays the Raspberry Pi Forum ( http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/ ), allowing people to quickly access help and troubleshooting.
- <b>Exit</b>: Quits NOOBS and reboots the Pi into the OS boot menu.

#### Online Help via Web Browser

The built-in Arora web browser allows you to easily get help via the Raspberry Pi Forums (wired network connection required).

#### Easy Config File Editor

The built-in config file editor allows you to edit the config file of the OS currently highlighted in the OS list. This allows you to easily add license keys to different OS installs through the same interface.

Note that the output mode selected by the user through pressing one of number keys 1 to 4 (for HDMI preferred, HDMI VGA, Composite PAL and Composite NTSC respectively), will be automatically set in the `config.txt` files of your installed OSes. This means that you shouldn't have to worry about manually changing your display settings to get your installed OS to display correctly on your display device.

#### How to boot into "Safe Mode"

To boot into a basic busybox shell rather than launching the NOOBS GUI, you can either:

1. Append `rescueshell` to the argument list in the `recovery.cmdline` file which is found in the root NOOBS directory.

2. Insert a physical jumper between pins 5 & 6 of GPIO header P1.

#### How to enable using the GPIO to trigger entering Recovery Mode

To force Recovery Mode to be entered on boot and to show the NOOBS interface, you normally press the `SHIFT` key during bootup. If you don't have a keyboard or the `SHIFT` keypress isn't being detected, you should complete the following steps to force the NOOBS interface to be displayed on boot:

1. Append `gpiotriggerenable` to the argument list in the `recovery.cmdline` file which is found in the root NOOBS directory.
2. Reboot

To force Recovery Mode being entered on boot, connect GPIO pin 3 on header P1 to GND (pin 25). If GPIO pin 3 remains unconnected then it will boot through to the installed OS as normal.

#### How to force Recovery Mode being entered on boot (overrides GPIO or keyboard input)

Alternatively, if you are unable to use either the GPIO or keyboard to trigger entering Recovery Mode, you can:

1. Append `forcetrigger` to the argument list in the `recovery.cmdline` file which is found in the root NOOBS directory.
2. Reboot

Note that with this option enabled, the Recovery Mode will be displayed <b>every</b> time you boot from your NOOBS card (until you edit `recovery.cmdline` again).

#### How to disable using the keyboard to trigger entering Recovery Mode

In some rare cases, you may find that NOOBS incorrectly detects a `SHIFT` keypress from your keyboard regardless of the presence of user input. In such cases it may be helpful to disable using the keyboard to trigger Recovery Mode being entered.

To prevent a `SHIFT` keypress from entering Recovery Mode on boot (maybe you have a problematic keyboard which is erroneously triggering every time you boot), you can:

1. Append `keyboardtriggerdisable` to the argument list in the `recovery.cmdline` file which is found in the root NOOBS directory.
2. Reboot

#### How to change display output modes

By default, NOOBS will output over HDMI at your displayâ€™s preferred resolution, even if no HDMI display is connected. If you do not see any output on your HDMI display or are using the composite output, press 1, 2, 3 or 4 on your keyboard to select HDMI preferred mode, HDMI safe mode, composite PAL mode or composite NTSC mode respectively.

If you don't have a keyboard, you can still change the display mode used by NOOBS through editing the `recovery.cmdline` file in the root NOOBS directory prior to first boot and appending the following argument:
- `display=<display mode number>` (e.g. `display=1` or `display=3`)

## How to Rebuild NOOBS

Note that this will require a minimum of 6GB free disk space.

#### Get Build Dependencies

On Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install build-essential rsync texinfo libncurses-dev whois unzip`

#### Run Build Script

`./BUILDME.sh`

Buildroot will then build the software and all dependencies, putting the result in the `output` directory.

Buildroot by default compiles multiple files in parallel, depending on the number of CPU cores you have.

If your build machine does have a quad core CPU, but relatively little RAM, you may want
to lower the number to prevent swapping:
- `cd buildroot ; make menuconfig`
- "Build options" -> "Number of jobs to run simultaneously"

## How to run your Build

In order to setup an SD card with a newly built version of NOOBS, you will need to:
- Format an SD card that is 4GB or greater in size as FAT
- Replace the `/os` directory in `/output` with the copy contained in the release version of NOOBS (see above for download links)
- Copy the files in the `/output` directory onto the SD card

## About the Buildroot infrastructure

To add extra packages: `cd buildroot ; make menuconfig`

Recovery software packaging is in: `buildroot/package/recovery`

Kernel configuration used: `buildroot/kernelconfig-recovery`

Main differences with bcmrpi_defconfig:
- `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y` - initramfs support
- `CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV=y` - evdev support built-in
- `CONFIG_USB_HID=y` - usb HID driver built-in
- All modules disabled.

## Modifying Qt source

Source is in the `recovery` folder.
Be aware that user interface screens will appear larger in Qt Creator then when deployed on the Pi, can
raise font sizes 2 points to compensate.

Several constants can be changed in `config.h`

Wrap code that calls Qt Embedded specific classes (such as QWSServer) between
```C
#ifdef Q_WS_QWS
```
and
```C
#endif
```
so that the project also compiles and can be tested under standard Qt.

## Adding/Updating Translations

References:

http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/i18n-source-translation.html

http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/linguist-manual.html

To set up a git pre-commit hook to automatically update the translation files, run the following commands in the project root:
- `chmod +x pre-commit-translation-update-hook.sh`
- `cp pre-commit-translation-update-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit`

To add a new translation:
- Add to `recovery/recovery.pro` the following: `TRANSLATIONS += translation_<languagecode>.ts`
- Run `lupdate recovery/recovery.pro` which extracts strings from the source code and generates/updates the *.ts* files.
- The *.ts* can then be sent to the translator, opened in Qt Linguist and filled in.
- Add a line for the *.ts* file in to `recovery/icons.qrc`, but substitute *.ts* extension with *.qm* . This file contains a list
  of resource files that will be embedded into the application's executable during build.
- Add a flag icon for your language from http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/ flag icon collection or if it
  doesn't have the one you need, you may use some other small png icon for it. Copy the icon file to the `recovery/icons`
  folder and add a line for it into `recovery/icons.qrc` as well.
